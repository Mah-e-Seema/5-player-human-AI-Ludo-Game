# 5-player-human-AI-Ludo-Game
This project is an innovative twist on the traditional Ludo board game, reimagined for 5 players with strategic AI integration. Developed as part of an AI course project, the game features a pentagon-shaped board, new power-ups, and a custom winning condition — all designed to create a more engaging and intelligent gameplay experience.

📌 Project Highlights

🧠 AI-Powered Gameplay: Uses a modified Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to handle multi-player decision-making.

🕹️ Interactive GUI: Built using Pygame for dynamic animations and a visually engaging experience.


♟️ Game Innovations:

-5-player support with a pentagonal board layout.

-3 tokens per player for faster pacing.

-Special tiles with power-ups (Double Roll, Safe Zone).

-New win condition: secure 2 tokens at home before others.


🚀 Features

Turn-based gameplay with fair dice rolls.

AI agents that use heuristics to maximize token safety and mobility.

Animated movement and real-time interaction.

Capture mechanics and strategy-enhancing power-ups.
